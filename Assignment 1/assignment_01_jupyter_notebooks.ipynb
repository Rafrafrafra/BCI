    "## 1. Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "A good resource to understand Jupyter notebooks is this [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=898687156&utm_adgroupid=48947256715&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=332602034352&utm_targetid=dsa-473406581035&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=1010397&gclid=CjwKCAjwnK36BRBVEiwAsMT8WD_WtNpLsPYARzHN-tH2fbxSlGhyMkFLnj-RcJz9SqyuRR6HVGa2HxoCpJcQAvD_BwE). Basiclly, Jupyter notebooks started as a project for the programming languages Julia, Python, and R, to enable coders to have an intuitive framework that can combine text, equations, and code. It is an extension of IPython, and is used a lot within the data science community. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is organized in cells. There are two main types of cells: \n",
    "- code cells;\n",
    "- markdown cells.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To change the type of a cell, select `Cell->Cell Type->Code/Markdown`, or use the hotkeys ('<b>Y</b>' for code, '<b>M</b>' for markdown; make sure to select the cell itself and not its contents).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell can be run separately and in any order you want. To run a cell you need to activate it by for example clicking on it. A <font color='green'>**green frame** means a cell is editable and active</font>, <font color='blue'>a **blue frame** means a cell is active and/or running</font>. To edit markdown cells you need to double click, which opens the source behind the displayed text. Try it on this cell! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) three ways to run the active cell.\n",
    "* Click on `Cell->RunCell` in the menu above;\n",
    "* Press **`CTRL+Enter`** and the marked cell is executed.\n",
    "* Press **`SHIFT+Enter`** and the marked cell is executed and the next cell is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of each cell is shown below the cell. The **number next to the cell on the left side** shows in which order the cells were run. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[*]` means that a cell is currently running. You can also verify this with the grey dot in the upper right corner of the notebook, which shows the state of the Python kernel. If the circle is filled grey, the kernel is executing something. If the circle is not filled (which should currently be the case), the kernel is ready to run the next cell. Note that you can queue multiple cells, and you don't have to wait for one cell to be finished before executing another! \n",
    "\n",
    "Because a Jupyer notebook is an interactive environment, and cells can be run in arbitrary order, be very cautious that things can get ugly quite quickly. For instance, the kernel keeps a workspace with all the variables that you created thus far. Make it a habit to clean the kernel now and then by executing `Kernel->Restart & Clean Output`, and check now and then whether your notebook runs from top to bottom by executing `Kernal->Restart & Run All`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From time to time you should save your notebook (the title of this page tells you when you saved the last time).\n",
    "You can also revert the notebook to the last checkpoint via `File->Revert to Checkpoint`.\n",
    " \n",
    "To terminate the notebook, you can either choose `File->Close And Halt`, terminate the notebook server in the shell\n",
    "(hitting `CTRL+C` twice) or just close the tab \n",
    "\n",
    "To hand in assignments, you can export notebooks with `File->Download as->Notebook (.ipynb)`. For other use cases, you can also use `File->Download as->Python (.py)`, this will you give you a python script with cells from top to bottom (markdown cells will only be comments). You can also dump it as a pdf `File->Download as->PDF via LaTeX (pdf)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case your notebook freezes or stops reacting you can *interrupt* the kernel (`Kernel->interrupt`) and it will stop executing the current cell. If you want to rerun your notebook (clear all output and delete all variables) you can select `Kernel-> Restart and Run All`"

    "## 2. Markdown\n",
    "Markdown is a text formatting language based on few simple symbols that the Jupyter Notebooks use to present text in a formatted way. Now *double click* into *this* cell and look at the unformatted Markdown code. For example, you use \\# to create headings. Just put more \\# after each other to create headings of different sizes.\n",

    "### 2.3 LaTex\n",
    "You can write formulas into Markdown cells using standard LaTeX formula notation. Do so by surrounding the equations by `\\$...\\$`. For instance:\n",
    "$ e^{i \\pi} + 1 = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Images\n",
    "You can also include images (e.g. scans of handwritten notes) into a markdown cell by using `![Image title](local_image.extension)`. When running the Markdown cell with the image, the image must exist locally as a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 (Pseudo) code\n",
    "In your assignment comments you may want to talk about parts of your code or function names, i.e. use code for illustrative purposes. When talking about `my_function()` within text as in this sentence, you can format `my_function()` as *code* by surrounding it with backtick quotes: \\`...\\`.\n",
